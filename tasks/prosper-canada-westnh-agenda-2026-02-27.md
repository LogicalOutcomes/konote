## Agenda

### 1. Feature Comparison Review (~10 min)

Feature comparison document was shared on Friday, February 21. Questions or feedback?

- Any features that are must-haves for WestNH that aren't listed?
- Any features listed that aren't relevant or shouldn't be turned on?
- Anything unclear in how a feature works?

### 2. Quick Demo (~15 min)

Walk through the latest iteration of KoNote — primarily for Claire's benefit.

- Demo instance is pre-loaded with financial coaching data (30 clients across 6 programs) to show realistic workflows
- Key areas to show: client intake, progress notes, outcome tracking, reporting

### 3. Hosting Update (~5 min)

WestNH's instance is already running on Azure (Canada Central, Toronto region), covered by their Microsoft for Nonprofits credits. Brief overview for context:

- Dedicated instance — WestNH's data is not shared with other agencies
- All participant data stays in Canada; encrypted at rest
- Covered by Azure's SOC 2, ISO 27001 certifications

### 4. What We Need from You (~10 min)

To configure the instance for WestNH, we'll need:

- **Staff list** — job titles and which program(s) each person works in
- **Programs/services** — the distinct programs you run (as you'd describe them to a funder)
- **Sensitive programs** — any services where even knowing someone is enrolled could cause harm
- **Current intake form** — what information you collect when someone first comes in
- **Terminology preferences** — what you call your participants (clients, participants, members), plans, notes, etc.

### 5. Next Steps (~5 min)

- **Sara to arrange requirements interviews** over the next one to two weeks (as per Statement of Work)
  - Session 1 — Discovery (~45 min): learn about your team, programs, and how you work
  - Session 2 — Decisions (~45 min): walk through specific choices about who can see what
- **Prep sheet** will be sent ahead of Session 1 so your team can think about the questions in advance
- **Who should be in the room for interviews:** Executive Director (or designate), at least one Program Manager, Front Desk lead, privacy officer (if applicable)
