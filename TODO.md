# Project Tasks

## Flagged

- [ ] **SHIP-BLOCKER:** Note views still use `@minimum_role("staff")` with global role fallback — same bug fixed in groups, unfixed in notes. Receptionist in Programme A + staff in Programme B can read clinical notes. See `tasks/permissions-review-prompt.md` (PERM-S1)
- [ ] **SHIP-BLOCKER:** Admin bypass in `get_client_or_403` contradicts permissions matrix — `if user.is_admin: return client` lets admins see all client data in all programmes. Admin should mean system config, not client data access (PERM-S2)
- [ ] **SHIP-BLOCKER:** No field-level enforcement for receptionist — `get_client_or_403` returns full `ClientFile` object. If template renders clinical fields, receptionist sees them. Need `client.get_visible_fields(role)` or template-level filtering (PERM-S3)
- [ ] Decide product name — should web version be called "KoNote" (not "KoNote2"). See `tasks/naming-versioning.md` (NAME1)
- [ ] Update konote-website git remote URL — repo was renamed to `konote2-website` but local remote still points to old `konote2` name (NAME2)

## Active Work

### Permissions Redesign — Phase 1 (Ship-Blockers)

- [ ] 🔨 Fix note views — apply `programme_role_required` so receptionist can't read clinical notes via global role fallback (PERM-S1)
- [ ] 🔨 Remove admin bypass from `get_client_or_403` + add negative access list — require admin to have programme role for client data access, add `ClientAccessBlock` model checked first (PERM-S2 + PERM-M3)
- [ ] 🔨 Add field-level filtering + cross-programme consent — receptionist templates must not render clinical fields, add `cross_programme_sharing_consent` on ClientFile (PERM-S3 + PERM-M1)

### Permissions Redesign — Phase 1 (Must-Add Before First Agency)

- [ ] 🔨 Narrow safety category + add missing matrix entries — remove medications from safety, add `user.manage`, `settings.manage`, `audit.view`, `consent.manage`, `intake.*`, delete permissions (PERM-M2 + PERM-M4)

### Permissions Redesign — Systemic Fix

- [ ] 🔨 Create Privacy-by-Design checklist — 5 questions to answer before any new feature ships (PERM-SYS1)

### QA Round 2c — Verification

- [ ] Re-run QA scenarios after deploy to confirm all fixes visible in screenshots (QA-VERIFY2)

### Pre-Launch Checklist

The core app is feature-complete. These tasks prepare for production use.

- [ ] Verify email is configured — needed for export notifications, erasure alerts, and password resets (OPS3)
- [ ] Test backup restore from a real database dump (OPS4)

### Occasional Tasks

- [ ] Run UX walkthrough — `pytest tests/ux_walkthrough/ -v`, review report at `tasks/ux-review-latest.md` (UX-WALK1)
- [ ] French translation review — have a French speaker spot-check AI translations, especially new strings. Run `python manage.py check_translations` to see coverage stats (I18N-REV1)
- [ ] Redeploy to Railway — push to `main`, Railway auto-deploys. See `docs/deploy-railway.md` (OPS-RAIL1)
- [ ] Redeploy to FullHost — push to `main`, then trigger redeploy via API or dashboard. See `docs/deploy-fullhost.md` (OPS-FH1)
- [ ] Code review round — open Claude Code in VS Code, say "review the codebase for code quality, security, and consistency issues" — see `tasks/code-review-process.md` (REV1)
- [ ] **Full QA Suite** — Run after major releases or UI changes. Creates 4 reports. **Step 1:** `/run-scenario-server` here (captures scenario screenshots). **Step 2:** Switch to qa-scenarios, run `/run-scenarios` (evaluates scenarios, creates satisfaction report + improvement tickets). **Step 3:** Back here, run `/capture-page-states` (captures page screenshots). **Step 4:** Switch to qa-scenarios, run `/run-page-audit` (evaluates pages, creates page audit report + tickets). **Step 5 (optional):** Back here, run `/process-qa-report` (expert panel + action plan). All reports saved to `qa-scenarios/reports/` with date stamps. Takes ~6-9 hours total. (QA-FULL1)

## Coming Up

### Permissions Redesign — Phase 2

- [ ] DV-safe Front Desk interface — per-programme config: `programme.receptionist_mode = "full_list" | "search_only"`. Search-only returns appointment info, never displays roster (PERM-P1)
- [ ] Consent model expansion — track consent scope (what), grantor (who), date, and withdrawal. Audit log for all consent changes (PERM-P2)
- [ ] Data extract governance — logging + board-designate visibility. Optional 48-hour delay before extract delivered. Don't build dual authorization unless funder/regulator requires it (PERM-P3)
- [ ] Role transition audit trail — never update `UserProgramRole.role` in place. Deactivate old, create new. History is the audit trail (PERM-P4)
- [ ] Reposition Programme Report as supervision tool — add caseload counts per worker, average session frequency, "no contact in 30 days" counts. Market internally, not as funder deliverable (PERM-P5)

### Export Monitoring

Weekly accountability reports for admins. Requires working email configuration (OPS3).

- [ ] Create weekly export summary email command (EXP2u)
- [ ] Document cron/scheduled task setup in runbook (EXP2w)

## Roadmap — Future Extensions

### Phase G: Agency Content Translation

Build when agencies have custom programs/metrics they need in multiple languages. See `tasks/multilingual-strategy.md`.

**G.1: Translation Infrastructure**
- [ ] Create TranslatableMixin with `translations` JSONField (I18N10)
- [ ] Add mixin to Program, MetricDefinition, PlanTemplate (I18N11)
- [ ] Create Settings → Translations admin page (I18N12)
- [ ] Update templates to display translated content (I18N13)

**G.2: AI Translation Integration**
- [ ] Create Settings → Integrations page for API keys (I18N14)
- [ ] Add "Suggest translation" button with AI (I18N15)

**G.3: Self-Service Languages**
- [ ] Create Settings → Languages management page (I18N16)
- [ ] Extend translation command for any target language (I18N17)

### Bulk Import

Build after secure export is stable. See `tasks/secure-export-import-plan.md` for design.

- [ ] Create ImportBatch model for tracking (IMP1a)
- [ ] Add import_batch FK to ClientFile model (IMP1b)
- [ ] Create CSV upload form with validation (IMP1c)
- [ ] Implement formula injection sanitisation (IMP1d)
- [ ] Implement duplicate detection (IMP1e)
- [ ] Create preview page showing what will be created (IMP1f)
- [ ] Implement batch import with transaction wrapping (IMP1g)
- [ ] Create rollback functionality — creations only, not updates (IMP1h)
- [ ] Add audit logging for imports (IMP1i)
- [ ] Create import history page for admins (IMP1j)
- [ ] Document import validation rules (DOC-IMP1)

### Other Planned Extensions

- [ ] Field data collection integrations — KoBoToolbox, Forms, or other tools (FIELD1)

### Explicitly Out of Scope

- ~~Calendar/scheduling~~ → Recommend Calendly, Google Calendar, Microsoft Bookings
- ~~Full document storage~~ → Recommend Google Drive, SharePoint, Dropbox
- ~~Full offline PWA~~ → Paper forms acceptable; basic offline banner added (BUG-6)
- ~~Multi-tenancy~~ → Fork required for coalition implementations

## QA Backlog

From Round 2c expert panel — lower priority items. See `tasks/qa-action-plan-2026-02-08.md`.

- [ ] Add onboarding guidance for new users — help link or first-run banner, not full wizard (IMPROVE-7 → QA-W19)
- [ ] Reduce form tab stops — tabindex audit, skip non-essential fields. Not yet tested. (IMPROVE-6 → QA-W20)

## Parking Lot

### QA Scenarios — Parking Lot

From konote-qa-scenarios. These require test infrastructure or app features in this repo.

- [ ] Stress testing — simulate 50+ concurrent users to find performance bottlenecks and connection pool limits (QA-T15)
- [ ] Data migration scenario — test what happens when importing client data from a legacy system. Validates the Bulk Import feature (IMP1 series) once built (QA-T16)

### Erasure — Deferred Execution for Tier 3

- [ ] Add 24-hour delay before Tier 3 (full erasure) CASCADE delete executes — requires background task scheduler, see `tasks/erasure-hardening.md` section ERASE-H8 (ERASE-H8)

### Deployment Workflow Enhancements

See [deployment workflow design](docs/plans/2026-02-05-deployment-workflow-design.md) for full details.

### Privacy & Security

- [ ] First-run setup wizard — guided initial configuration (SETUP1)
- [ ] TOTP multi-factor authentication for local auth — see `tasks/mfa-implementation.md` (SEC2)
- [ ] Encrypted search optimisation (search hash field) for 2000+ client lists (PERF1)
- [ ] Bulk operations for discharge, assign (UX17)

## Recently Done

- [x] Fix BLOCKER-1 skip link conflict — implemented Option B (auto-focus main content, remove skip link) per expert panel consensus.
