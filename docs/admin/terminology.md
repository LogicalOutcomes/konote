## Common Questions

### Q: Can I change terminology later?
**A:** Yes. Changes apply immediately to all users. Historical data (existing notes, exports) retains the terminology that was in use when it was created.

### Q: What happens to exports when I change a term?
**A:** New exports use the current terminology. Previously generated exports are not affected.

### Q: Can I set different terms for English and French?
**A:** Yes. Each term has separate English and French fields. If you leave French blank, the English value is used.
